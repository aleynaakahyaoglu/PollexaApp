# PollexaApp

I developed it by UIkit with MVVM architecture.

I cropped the pollexa image I took from Figma designs and added it as an application icon.

I improved the splash screen by adding animation to the splash screen in Figma.

I created a nature-themed data set and displayed this data in the cell I designed.

I have listed cells in CollectionView.
